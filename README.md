This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their estimated annual income and spending score. The dataset is loaded from a mall customers dataset, and the two selected features are standardized for better clustering performance. K-Means groups the customers into five distinct clusters, each labeled with descriptive business categories such as high-income high spenders or low-income low spenders. The cluster centroids are computed in standardized space and then transformed back to the original scale for interpretation. The output is a scatter plot displaying the customer segments and centroids, enabling targeted marketing and actionable business insights.
