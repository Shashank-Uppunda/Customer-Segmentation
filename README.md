This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their estimated annual income and spending score. It involves loading a mall customers dataset and selecting key features. The dataset is clustered into five distinct groups, each representing different customer profiles such as high-income high spenders or low-income low spenders. Cluster centroids are calculated and annotated with descriptive business labels. The output includes a scatter plot showing customer segments and their centroids to help visualize the distinct groups for targeted marketing and business insights.
